# DataStructure
Repository for de advance in the third module of capacitation for software develop
## In IncrementalProject:
you will find the progress of the model, with linked lists, queues, stacks and others
In this project there are the Tower of Hanoi and Bubble Sort tasks in the "homeworks" folder, they have their own main to run
The program can be accessed from the main Main, from where you can execute all the structures created, linked list, stacks, queues, binary tree, graph and mergesort, allowing everything to be executed until you decide to close the program
## In Project:
you can find the progress of the group project (in my case, only mine)
The project is a queue management system for a hospital, everything starts from the external main, allowing the execution of the GeneralQueueRunner, from where all options and queues of the system are managed (general, emergency and the different specialties)
